Problem 17: Move All Zeros to the End While Maintaining the Relative Order of Non-Zero Elements

Given an array of integers, rearrange the array such that all the zeros are moved to the end, while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The array should remain the same size, with only the position of elements rearranged.

<h3> Example: </h3>

```
Input:
array = [0, 1, 0, 2, 9, 3, 0, 2];
