Problem 07+: Make Palindrome

You are tasked with creating a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forward as backward. 
If the input string is not a palindrome, your function should attempt to rearrange its characters to form a palindrome. If successful, return the modified string; otherwise, 
return an appropriate response indicating that it is not possible to create a palindrome from the given string.

<h3> Example: </h3>

```
Input: abcab
Output: myStr = abcab is palindrome when myStr = abcba
```

```
Input: abc
Output: abc can not make into palindrome
```
