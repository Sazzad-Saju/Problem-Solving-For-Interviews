Problem 15: Find a number in a 2D array

You have given an 2d array
[
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 0],
    [4, 5, 6, 7, 10]
]

you have to find a number in this 2d array with  nlogn time complexity, not n2 . 
let's say, you have to find 10 from the avobe array 

return row & column number as result 
10 we found at row = 2, column = 4

<br>
<h3> Example: </h3>

```
Input:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 0],
    [4, 5, 6, 7, 10]
]
Target: 10
Output: { row: 2, column: 4 }

```
