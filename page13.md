Problem 11: Polimorphism example

Using a common interface show a polimorphism example. Class Parrot and Class Panguin. Both have object, now test both object using basic interface testBird.

<br>
<h3> Example: </h3>

```
Input: parrot obj, panguine obj
Output: 
parrot cann't swim
parrot can fly
penguin can swim
penguin can't fly

```


<br>
Use two interface addition and substruction and implements those on class Arithmatic. (only on php)

<h3> Example: </h3>

```
Input: 
35 25
35 25
Output:
60
10

```

<br>

Show Basic abstruct class in both php and js. In php: create a abstruct parentClass with abstruct method add() and shows how childClass can inherit that to use as a blueprint. The child class will provide the implimentation for 
abstruct method add() of the parent class. <br>
Also shows abstruct class concepts in js. Create class Bike and Vehicle, shows bike is an instance of vehicle also of itself. <br>
Both code simulates the concept of abstruct class.
